## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **API Keys & Secrets**
   - Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Implement proper secret rotation

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all external inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Review dependency security advisories

4. **Trading Logic**
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Validate trading parameters
   - Use deterministic algorithms only

### For Users

1. **API Configuration**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good: Secure API configuration
   const config = {
       apiKey: process.env.BINANCE_API_KEY,
       secret: process.env.BINANCE_SECRET,
       sandbox: true, // Start with sandbox
       permissions: ['spot'] // Minimal permissions
   };
   
   // ❌ Bad: Hardcoded credentials
   const config = {
       apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
       secret: 'your-secret-here'
   };
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create secure .env file
   echo "BINANCE_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
   echo "BINANCE_SECRET=your_secret_here" >> .env
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

3. **Trading Permissions**
   - Use API keys with minimal required permissions
   - Enable IP restrictions when possible
   - Regularly rotate API keys
   - Monitor API usage

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **CodeQL Analysis** - Static code analysis
- **Dependency Scanning** - Known vulnerability detection
- **Security Linting** - Security anti-patterns detection
- **Secret Scanning** - Accidental secret detection

### Manual Security Reviews

- All PRs undergo security review
- Critical components receive thorough analysis
- External security audits (when applicable)

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns

### ❌ What NOT to do:

1. **Never store secrets in code**
2. **Don't disable TLS verification**
3. **Avoid eval() or similar dynamic execution**
4. **Don't trust user input without validation**
5. **Never log sensitive information**

### ✅ Security Checklist:

- [ ] Environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Logging excludes sensitive data
- [ ] API permissions are minimal
- [ ] Test data doesn't contain real credentials

## 🔐 Cryptographic Standards

### Random Number Generation
```javascript
// ✅ Secure: Deterministic RNG with cryptographic seed
const { kernelRNG } = require('./src/utils/kernel-rng.js');
kernelRNG.seed(secureRandomSeed);

// ❌ Insecure: Math.random() for trading decisions
const random = Math.random();
```

### Data Protection
- Use TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Implement proper session management
- Hash sensitive data when storing
- Use secure comparison for authentication

## 📊 Trading-Specific Security

### Position Management
- Validate position sizes
- Implement maximum loss limits
- Use circuit breakers for anomalies
- Monitor for unusual patterns

### Market Data
- Validate data sources
- Implement sanity checks
- Use multiple data sources when possible
- Monitor for data manipulation

### Order Execution
- Validate order parameters
- Implement rate limiting
- Use proper authentication
- Monitor execution patterns

## 🔄 Incident Response

### If You Discover a Security Issue:

1. **Stop**: Don't continue testing if you find something serious
2. **Document**: Record exactly what you found
3. **Report**: Use our private disclosure process
4. **Wait**: Don't disclose publicly until we've had time to fix

### Our Response Process:

1. **Triage**: Assess impact and severity
2. **Develop**: Create and test fix
3. **Deploy**: Release security update
4. **Communicate**: Notify users of the issue
5. **Learn**: Improve processes to prevent recurrence
